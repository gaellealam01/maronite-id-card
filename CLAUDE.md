## About the Developer

This is my first time coding. I am a complete amateur. When explaining things, asking questions, or suggesting changes, always use simple, beginner-friendly language. Avoid jargon — and if you must use a technical term, explain it in plain English.

## Project

Maronite League ID Card Generator — a Node.js/Express web app that generates membership ID cards with photos, QR codes, and Excel export.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, better-sqlite3
- **Frontend:** Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS (single-page app in `public/`)
- **Database:** SQLite (`maronite.db`)
- **Other:** ExcelJS for spreadsheet export, multer for file uploads, canvas/qrcode for image generation

## Key Commands

- `npm start` — runs the server (`node server.js`)
